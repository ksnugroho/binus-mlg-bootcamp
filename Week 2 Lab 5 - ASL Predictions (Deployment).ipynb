        "Great work on these exercises! You've gone through the full process of training a highly accurate model from scratch, and then using the model to make new and valuable predictions. If you have some time, we encourage you to take pictures with your webcam, upload them by dropping them into the data/asl_images folder, and test out the model on them. For Mac you can use Photo Booth. For windows you can select the Camera app from your start screen. We hope you try it. It's a good opportunity to learn some sign language! For instance, try out the letters of your name.\n",
